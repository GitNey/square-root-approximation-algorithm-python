# square-root-approximation-algorithm-python
An implementation of a square root approximation algorithm utilizing threshold approximation precison in novice python.

Clone repo and run with: `python main.py`

You will be prompted for input to guess the square root of a given number, in this case 25. The algorithm approximates until it can arrive to a conclusion given a threshold.
